# Learning and Testing various GPGPU Algorithms
From my work/time at Red Hat, summer 2024, as an intern in the accelerators/RHEL.ai group

Frameworks used:
* CUDA
* OpenCL
* HIP
* Triton
* Numba

Some Algorithms implemented:
* Parallel prefix sum/scan
* Quicksort
* Game of Life
* Triton Puzzles

Also contains:
* Debug work from testing Triton/GPU functionality on ROCm
* Testing work to make sure everything works smoothly
